### What is your name and where are you from?

My name is Ogundele Olumide. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria where I grew up. I have spent the last 3 years travelling across the South-western part of Nigeria for school, work and get-aways.

### what do you do and what do you love about it?

I am a Professional Software Engineer with about 2 years experience working professionally but had started coding or building projects 4 years ago.

I love software development for many reason but to mention a few.
I love the way it makes me learn something new everyday, how it affords me the opportunity to bring my thoughts to life, helps me connect with people by building products for them, bring my creative part to life and the mixed feeling of the frustration, joy and the "aha-moments" that comes with solving problems when working on projects.

### What are your experiences?


I currently work in [Andela](https://andela.com/), where I have had the opportunity to work with distributed teams across many countries and continents building different products with different technologies. I have had the privilege to take up leadership position for the company by being a Technical Coordinator where I mentor new Software Engineers in the apprenticeship space of the company, we do code reviews, coaching sessions, one-on-ones and have stakeholders meetings with the product owners.

Before joining Andela, I have the privilege to work as  Logistics Officer(3 years) for [Dangote Industries](https://dangote.com/) in the Supply Chain and Distribution department where I was also tasked with a leadership position of being the interim Inventory Manager.

### What are your interests ?

I love learning. I am still interested in being a Full-Stack Software Engineer and more interested in Distributed Systems, Site Reliability Engineering and Machine Learning.

I love spending time with my family, friends, discussing ideas that challenges my thinking and reading books that are not related to Software Engineering.

I also love contributing to open source, I am an active contributor to [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) - a flexible, open source messaging platform
that enables secure team collaboration.
